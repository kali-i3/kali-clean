# Kali-Clean

My kali i3 desktop setup fork from xct with additions and some personal tweaks/changes.

Updated Alacritty 0.13.2-2+b3

Added feroxbuster, batcat, Sublime-Editor, seclists, mc, htop.

Unzip rockyou password list.

After cloning the repo just run ./install.sh from a non-root user. This updates kali and installs a lot of stuff, so it will take a while. Feel free to optimize ;)

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/lavrinovich86/kali-clean.git
cd kali-clean
./install.sh
```

After the script is done reboot and select i3 (top right corner) on the login screen. Then open a terminal (`ctrl+return`) run `lxappearance`and select ark-dark theme and change the icons to whatever you like (I used papyrus).
